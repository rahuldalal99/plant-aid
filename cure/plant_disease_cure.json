Space vines properly and choose a planting site where the vines will be exposed to full sun and good air circulation. Keep the vines off the ground and insure they are properly tied, limiting the amount of time the vines remain wet thus reducing infection.</li><li>Sanitation. Keep the fruit planting and surrounding areas free of weeds and tall grass. This practice will promote lower relative humidity and rapid drying of vines and thereby limit fungal infection.</li><li>Pruning. Prune the vines in early winter during dormancy. Select only a few strong, healthy canes from the previous year\u2019s growth to produce the following season\u2019s crop. Remove these prunings from the vineyard and burn or destroy.</li><li>Cultivation. Cultivate the vineyard before budbreak to bury the mummified berries. Diseased berries covered with soil do not produce spores that will reach the developing vines. For homegrown grapes, use 2\u20133 inches of leaf mulch or fine bark to cover infected debris.</li><li>Fungicides. Use protective fungicide sprays. Pesticides registered to protect the developing new growth include copper, captan, ferbam, mancozeb, maneb, triadimefon, and ziram. Important spraying times are as new shoots are 2 to 4 inches long, and again when they are 10 to 15 inches long, just before bloom, just after bloom, and when the fruit has set.</li><li>Cultivars. Cultivars with large, juicy berries are the most susceptible. In general, grapes that ripen late in the season are affected the least. Most commercial cultivars are sufficiently resistant if adequately protected with a fungicide spray program.</li>"}{"plant_id": "2", "disease_id": "3", "cure": "</li><li>In India, delaying pruning to as late as possible in the dormant season (February or later) has been shown to be very effective in reducing the risk of infection. Delayed pruning takes advantage of reduced susceptibility of pruning wounds to infection and avoids the period of highest spore release during typically frequent rain events in December and January. Double pruning is a modified version of delayed pruning for large acreages of cordon-trained, spur-pruned vines; pre-pruning is done in early winter (most often mechanically) by cutting canes to 12 to 18-inches above the final pruning cuts, followed by hand pruning to create spurs in February or later. If delayed pruning is not feasible or for additional protection, consider treating pruning wounds with a protectant. Keep in mind that all wounds made in the dormant season are susceptible; this includes pruning cuts made to canes or larger cuts made to re-position/re-orient spurs.</li><li>Although preventative practices are most effective in young vineyards (before the vines become infected by trunk diseases), these practices have some utility in diseased mature vineyards. Wood cankers are very localized, thus protecting more pruning wounds means fewer new cankers each year resulting in fewer dead spurs, arms or canes over time.</li><li>Post-infection practices (sanitation and vine surgery) for use in diseased, mature vineyards are not as effective and are far more costly than adopting preventative practices (delayed pruning, double pruning, and applications of pruning-wound protectants) in young vineyards. Nonetheless, sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and destroy it. Vine surgery involves retraining new cordons or trunks as needed to maintain production. There is a higher success rate when retraining a new trunk, as most of the infections are concentrated in the upper portions of the permanent vine framework.</li>List of Pesticides<li>THIOPHANATE-METHYL</li><li>THIOPHANATE-METHYL</li> MYCLOBUTANIL</li><li> TETRACONAZOLE</li>"}{"plant_id": "3", "disease_id": "5", "cure": "<li>Plant healthy, disease-free seed potatoes from a reputable supplier.
