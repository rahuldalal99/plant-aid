[{"disease_id":1,"disease_name":"Cercospora Leaf Spot","disease_symptoms":"Pathogen survives mainly in plant debris as desiccation-resistant pseudostromata, but can also survive as conidia in debris or seeds. When moisture is sufficient, new conidia are formed and spread via rain-splash or wind to new leaves or plants. Optimum conditions are 77\u00b0 to 95\u00b0 F with night temperatures above 61\u00b0 F, and a relative humidity of 90-95%. Infection is greatly reduced or nonexistent at temperatures less than 59\u00b0 F or during periods of leaf wetness less than 11 hours.","disease_causes":"Infection and lesion formation initially occur on older leaves before progressing to newer ones.\u00a0Lesions\u00a0at maturity are 1\/8 inch in diameter and appear light gray-colored to dark tan with a brown to purple border. Severely\u00a0affected leaves\u00a0wither and die from coalescing lesions. A diagnostic feature is the presence of tiny black dots (pseudostromata) that form in leaf substomatal cavities within the grayish-tan lesions. The pseudostromata produce conidiophores borne in clusters that serve as\u00a0conidia-bearing structures. Pseudostromata are visible with a hand lens, and after exposure of leaves to high humidity, entire lesions appear fuzzy due to the presence of numerous conidia."},{"disease_id":2,"disease_name":"Common Rust","disease_symptoms":"Early lesions on leaves are small, circular to elongate, and often occur in clusters. As lesions mature, the fungus erupts through the leaf surface (epidermis) and the lesions become more elongated. At this stage, a prominent yellow halo is usually evident. Brownish-red oblong pustules are the characteristic symptom on leaves; urediniospores that rub off on fingers are what impart the color to the lesion. Unlike Southern Rust of Corn, lesions of common rust are sparsely spread over the leaf and occur on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Spores are wind-blown with new infections occurring every 7 to 14 days. As the season progresses, black teliospores are produced within the lesions. During this process, a single lesion may produce both brownish-red urediniospores and black teliospores. Finally, only black teliospores will be observed within the lesions.","disease_causes":"Cool temperatures (60-80\u00b0 F) and high humidity favor disease development."},{"disease_id":3,"disease_name":"Esca","disease_symptoms":"Esca  is one of the \"trunk diseases\" caused by different wood-infecting fungi. The foliar symptom of Esca is an\u00a0interveinal \"striping\". The \"stripes\", which start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, dry and become necrotic. Foliar symptoms may occur at any time during the growing season, but are most prevalent during July and August. They are often restricted to an individual shoot or to shoots originating from the same spur or cane.\u00a0Symptomatic leaves\u00a0can dry completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round,\u00a0dark spots\u00a0each bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots, which are better viewed on white cultivars, may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening. In\u00a0severely affected\u00a0vines, the berries often crack and\u00a0dry\u00a0or are subject to spoilage. Symptomatic fruit is found only on shoots with symptomatic leaves, but you can find shoots with symptomatic leaves and no symptomatic fruit. Cross-sectional cuts through canes, spurs, cordons, or trunks from which symptomatic shoots originate will reveal concentric rings of dark spots. Eventually the spur or cane from which symptomatic shoots originate may die. The appearance of foliar and especially fruit symptoms is inconsistent from year to year, which is thought to be due to possibly climate-induced variability in toxin production by the pathogen. A severe form of Esca known as \"apoplexy\", which is more common in Europe, results in a sudden dieback of the entire shoot or adjacent shoots, rather than a gradual development of foliar symptoms.","disease_causes":"Symptoms first become apparent in vineyards 5 to 7 or more years old, but the infections actually occur in younger vines. The overwintering structures that produce spores (perithecia or pycnidia, depending on the pathogen) are embedded in diseased woody parts of vines. During fall to spring rainfall, spores are released and wounds made by dormant pruning provide infection sites. Wounds may remain susceptible to infection for several weeks after pruning with susceptibility declining over time. After a pruning wound is infected, the pathogen establishes a permanent, localized wood infection, which cannot be eradicated by fungicide applications."},{"disease_id":4,"disease_name":"Black Rot","disease_symptoms":"The black rot fungus overwinters in canes, tendrils, and leaves on the grape vine and on the ground. Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection. Cool weather slows growth of the fungus. It requires warm weather for optimal growth and a period of 2 to 3 days of rain, drizzle, or fog","disease_causes":"Leaves:\u00a0Reddish brown and circular to angular spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves starting in late spring. As spots merge, they form irregular, reddish brown blotches. The number of spots or lesions per leaf varies from 2 to more than 100 depending on the severity of the disease. The center of the leaf spot turns tannish brown and is surrounded by a black margin. Black, speck-sized fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are arranged in a definite ring just inside the margin of the lesion. Only young, rapidly growing leaves are affected. Fruit:\u00a0Shortly after the flower petals fall, fruit infection can occur. Most infections start when the fruit is half to almost full size. A small spot will appear that becomes circular and whitish tan, often surrounded by a brown ring. This happens while the berry is still green. The spots grow rapidly and may cover half of the berry within 48 hours. Within a few days the entire berry becomes coal black, hard, and mummified. The surface of the withered fruit is soon covered with minute, black, pimple-like, sporeproducing pycnidia that are arranged in circular zones."},{"disease_id":5,"disease_name":"Blight","disease_symptoms":"Blight, any of various\u00a0plant\u00a0diseases whose symptoms include sudden and severe yellowing, browning, spotting, withering, or dying of\u00a0leaves,\u00a0flowers,\u00a0fruit,\u00a0stems, or the entire plant.","disease_causes":"Most\u00a0blights\u00a0are caused by\u00a0bacterial\u00a0or\u00a0fungal\u00a0infestations, which usually attack the shoots and other young, rapidly growing tissues of a plant. Fungal and bacterial blights are most apt to occur under cool moist conditions, and most economically important plants are susceptible to one or more blights, including\u00a0tomatoes,\u00a0potatoes, and\u00a0apples, as well as many ornamental species."},{"disease_id":6,"disease_name":"Bacterial Spot","disease_symptoms":"On tomato, leaf lesions are initially circular and water-soaked and may be surrounded by a faint yellow halo. In general, spots are dark brown to black and circular on leaves and stems. Spots rarely develop to more than 3 mm in diameter. Lesions can coalesce causing a blighted appearance of leaves and a general yellowing may occur on leaves with multiple lesions. Infected pepper leaves drop prematurely; this exposes fruit to the sun and results in sun scalding. Fruit lesions begin as small, slightly raised blisters, which become dark brown, scab-like, and can appear slightly raised as they increase in size.","disease_causes":"Bacterial spot is caused by four species of\u00a0Xanthomonas\u00a0and occurs worldwide wherever tomatoes are grown. Bacterial spot causes leaf and fruit spots, which leads to defoliation, sun-scalded fruit, and yield loss. Due to diversity within the bacterial spot pathogens, the disease can occur at different temperatures and is a threat to tomato production worldwide. Disease development is favored by temperatures of 75 to 86 \u2109 and high precipitation. In India, it is more prevalent in seasons with high precipitation and less prevalent during dry years."},{"disease_id":7,"disease_name":"Mold","disease_symptoms":"The oldest leaves are infected first.

Spots are circular, about 1\/16 to 1\/4 inch in diameter with dark brown margins and tan to gray centers with small black fruiting structures. Characteristically, there are many spots per leaf. This disease spreads upwards from oldest to youngest growth. If leaf lesions are numerous, the leaves turn slightly yellow, then brown, and then wither. Fruit infection is rare.","disease_causes":"The fungus overwinters on infected tomato debris or on weeds in the nightshade family, the same family to which tomatoes belong. The fungus can also survive on equipment such as plant stakes and cages. Long periods of high relative humidity, temperatures of 60\u201380 degrees F, and leaf wetness are ideal conditions for development and spread of the pathogen."},{"disease_id":9,"disease_name":"Spider Mites","disease_symptoms":"Initially, spider mite damage will appear as small yellow or brown spots on the leaves of the plant. If the plant is badly infested, the plant\u2019s health will suffer and it may develop completely yellow leaves and may stop growing. Spider mite damage may also include a telltale spider web type webbing on the plant. Spider mites are arachnids and are related to spiders. They produce webs in order to protect themselves and their eggs.","disease_causes":"Spider mites on houseplants and outdoor plants is a common problem. Spider mite damage can not only make a plant look unsightly, it can even kill the plant. It is important to use a spider mite treatment as soon as possible on an affected plant in order to keep the plant looking its best and healthiest. "},{"disease_id":10,"disease_name":"Target Spot","disease_symptoms":"On the leaves the disease starts as small circular to oval dark brown to black spots. These spots enlarge, becoming oval to angular, and are normally confined within the main veins of the leaflets. They are up to 6 mm in diameter. Under very favourable conditions individual spots can grow to 10-12 mm. They become leathery looking, and the development of close concentric rings within each spot gives the disease its name, target spot. When the disease is severe, spots can unite and cause an upward rolling of the leaf tips and death of leaves. Spots that develop on stems are more elongated than those on the leaves. Target spot can sometimes infect the tubers. It appears as small dark, slightly sunken, circular to irregular-shaped lesions (10 to 20 mm in diameter), with slightly raised margins. A brownish, corky dry rot up to 6 mm deep develops in the tissue beneath the lesion. Affected tubers are prone to attack from other soil fungi which can cause complete rotting of the tuber.","disease_causes":"The disease is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani.
