Brownish-red oblong pustules are the characteristic symptom on leaves; urediniospores that rub off on fingers are what impart the color to the lesion. Unlike Southern Rust of Corn, lesions of common rust are sparsely spread over the leaf and occur on both upper and lower leaf surfaces. Spores are wind-blown with new infections occurring every 7 to 14 days. As the season progresses, black teliospores are produced within the lesions.

The \"stripes\", which start out as dark red in red cultivars and yellow in white cultivars, dry and become necrotic. Foliar symptoms may occur at any time during the growing season, but are most prevalent during July and August. They are often restricted to an individual shoot or to shoots originating from the same spur or cane.\u00a0Symptomatic leaves\u00a0can dry completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round,\u00a0dark spots\u00a0each bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots, which are better viewed on white cultivars, may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening. In\u00a0severely affected\u00a0vines, the berries often crack and\u00a0dry\u00a0or are subject to spoilage. Symptomatic fruit is found only on shoots with symptomatic leaves, but you can find shoots with symptomatic leaves and no symptomatic fruit. Cross-sectional cuts through canes, spurs, cordons, or trunks from which symptomatic shoots originate will reveal concentric rings of dark spots. Eventually the spur or cane from which symptomatic shoots originate may die. The appearance of foliar and especially fruit symptoms is inconsistent from year to year, which is thought to be due to possibly climate-induced variability in toxin production by the pathogen. A severe form of Esca known as \"apoplexy\", which is more common in Europe, results in a sudden dieback of the entire shoot or adjacent shoots, rather than a gradual development of foliar symptoms.",
      "disease_causes":"Symptoms first become apparent in vineyards 5 to 7 or more years old, but the infections actually occur in younger vines. The overwintering structures that produce spores (perithecia or pycnidia, depending on the pathogen) are embedded in diseased woody parts of vines. During fall to spring rainfall, spores are released and wounds made by dormant pruning provide infection sites. Wounds may remain susceptible to infection for several weeks after pruning with susceptibility declining over time. After a pruning wound is infected, the pathogen establishes a permanent, localized wood infection, which cannot be eradicated by fungicide applications."

Mummified berries on the ground or those that are still clinging to the vines become the major infection source the following spring. During rain, microscopic spores (ascospores) are shot out of numerous, black fruiting bodies (perithecia) and are carried by air currents to young, expanding leaves. In the presence of moisture, these spores germinate in 36 to 48 hours and eventually penetrate the leaves and fruit stems. The infection becomes visible after 8 to 25 days. When the weather is wet, spores can be released the entire spring and summer providing continuous infection. Cool weather slows growth of the fungus. It requires warm weather for optimal growth and a period of 2 to 3 days of rain, drizzle, or fog",
      "disease_causes":"Leaves:\u00a0Reddish brown and circular to angular spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves starting in late spring. As spots merge, they form irregular, reddish brown blotches. The number of spots or lesions per leaf varies from 2 to more than 100 depending on the severity of the disease. The center of the leaf spot turns tannish brown and is surrounded by a black margin. Black, speck-sized fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are arranged in a definite ring just inside the margin of the lesion. Only young, rapidly growing leaves are affected. Fruit:\u00a0Shortly after the flower petals fall, fruit infection can occur. Most infections start when the fruit is half to almost full size. A small spot will appear that becomes circular and whitish tan, often surrounded by a brown ring. This happens while the berry is still green. The spots grow rapidly and may cover half of the berry within 48 hours. Within a few days the entire berry becomes coal black, hard, and mummified. The surface of the withered fruit is soon covered with minute, black, pimple-like, sporeproducing pycnidia that are arranged in circular zones."

Delayed pruning takes advantage of reduced susceptibility of pruning wounds to infection and avoids the period of highest spore release during typically frequent rain events in December and January. Double pruning is a modified version of delayed pruning for large acreages of cordon-trained, spur-pruned vines; pre-pruning is done in early winter (most often mechanically) by cutting canes to 12 to 18-inches above the final pruning cuts, followed by hand pruning to create spurs in February or later.

Nonetheless, sanitation and vine surgery may help maintain yields. In spring, look for dead spurs or for stunted shoots. Later in summer, when there is a reduced chance of rainfall, practice good sanitation by cutting off these cankered portions of the vine beyond the canker, to where wood appears healthy. Then remove diseased, woody debris from the vineyard and destroy it. Vine surgery involves retraining new cordons or trunks as needed to maintain production.
